# boredBoard

I created this webpage to practice Javascript and DOM manipulations.

Implementing the dynamic board was a real challenge, and although it's still not perfect, it does work as expected.

I wondered how I was going to create the board and how I was going to make an individual tile change color without affecting the other tiles.

This project seemed impossible to me at the time, but I am happy that I went through with it as I was able to create something close to what I had envisioned.

I plan on implementing more features to this project as I learn more about full-stack engineering.
